But if you're asking about the earliest recorded civilization in what is now modern-day China, that would be the Xia Dynasty, which is believed to have started around 2100 BCE.\n\nHowever, the concept of \"China\" as a unified nation-state has gone through many transformations and changes throughout its history. So, it's not possible to give an exact age for China as we know it today. But I hope that gives you a rough idea of the country's ancient roots!",
